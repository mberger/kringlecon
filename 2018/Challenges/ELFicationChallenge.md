Christmas is coming, and so it would seem,
ER (Elf Resources) crushes elves' dreams.
One tells me she was disturbed by a bloke.
He tells me this must be some kind of joke.

Please do your best to determine what's real.
Has this jamoke, for this elf, got some feels?
Lethal forensics ain't my cup of tea;
If YOU can fake it, my hero you'll be.

One more quick note that might help you complete,
Clearing this mess up that's now at your feet.
Certain text editors can leave some clue.
Did our young Romeo leave one for you?

Thank you for solving this mystery, Slick.
Reading the .viminfo sure did the trick.
Leave it to me; I will handle the rest.
Thank you for giving this challenge your best.

### Tangle Coalbox's Hints after
Tangle Coalbox4:41PM
Hey, thanks for the help with the investigation, gumshoe.
Have you been able to solve the lock with the funny shapes?
It reminds me of something called "de Bruijn Sequences."
You can optimize the guesses because there is no start and stop -- each new value is added to the end and the first is removed.
I've even seen de Bruijn sequence generators online.
Here the length of the alphabet is 4 (only 4 buttons) and the length of the PIN is 4 as well.
Mathematically this is k=4, n=4 to generate the de Bruijn sequence.
Math is like your notepad and pencil - can't leave home without it!
I heard Alabaster lost his badge! That's pretty bad. What do you think someone could do with that?

### Key was one of the first 10 in the sequence, not sure which one.. lol
