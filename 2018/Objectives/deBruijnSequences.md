This lock has a 0 Triangle, 1 square, 2 circle and 3 star.
According to the hints during the ForensicELFication Cranberry Pi terminal challenge it's 4 characters and 4 positions so 4^4 = 256 possible combinations.

I ran this through an online de Bruijn calculator and got a bunch of combinations. Starting at the beginning I bruit forced this by entering combos starting at the beginning with 0000.

The answer I got was 0120 which is equal to  Triangle square circle triangle.  Poor star was left out.
