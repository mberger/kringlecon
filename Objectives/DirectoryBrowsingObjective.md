``` Who submitted (First Last) the rejected talk titled Data Loss for Rainbow Teams: A Path in the Darkness? Please analyze the CFP site to find out. For hints on achieving this objective, please visit Minty Candycane and help her with the The Name Game Cranberry Pi terminal challenge. ```

This one was pretty easy I simply went to https://cfp.kringlecastle.com/
Clicked on the CPF link which took me here https://cfp.kringlecastle.com/cfp/cfp.html
I took the ctp.html off and was able to browse the directory where there was a file called rejected-talks.csv
Searching that for the title from the question finds the answer.
